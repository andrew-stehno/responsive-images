# responsive-images

This is a simple app which allowed me to practice responsive coding
for mobile first development.

Additionally, I utilized webpack and postcss to introduce different practices, which 
would no doubt be beneficial on larger scale developments.

## HTML

- BEM philosophy.
- Use of the *picture* tag with *srcsets* and media queries to properly set image
size per screen size.
- Use of *srcsets* with the *img* tag to allow browsers to chose which image fits best.

## CSS

- Module folder setup to cleanly organize CSS per block.
- Use of postcss to write nested CSS to follow the BEM philosophy.

## JavaScript

- Class templates
- Constructor functions
